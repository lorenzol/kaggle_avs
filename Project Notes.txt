how to deal with negatives

add average amount, like avg amunt spent etc....


I tried R package glmnet(alpha = 0, lambda = 2^17, family = "binomial") on the Triskelion's features except offer_quantity and got 0.59565. 

The reason for the difference between Upul's score and mine may be the parameter estimation method employed by glmnet. 

See Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent in detail.

Glmnet model can be improved by Bagging. The LB score of bagged glmnet using the same features and paramters was 0.60427.


models
try combining the glmnet model with the positives of the glm model.



New feature
===========

spending pattern is it increasing or decreasing?
could be a good indicator of likelyhood to spend?>
